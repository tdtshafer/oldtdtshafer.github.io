<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>I enjoy having fun.</h3>

<p>From photography to music to sports to studying, I enjoy turning problems into puzzles and solving them. Formulating strategies, executing plans, and taking calculated risks are exhilarating to me. I spend most of my thinking time outside of the box. I'll probably never be a politician.</p>

<p>Travis lives off-campus with his beautiful wife, Jenna Marie Shafer. He spends time operating his commercial photography business, making music, playing sports, and doing dishes. He also operates a social media account for social justice called @ForgetPorn, encouraging men to escape the dangerous addiction of pornography. Travis wants to serve people the way that Jesus did, and volunteers with groups like The Bay and I've Got a Name in Lincoln. He is currently a senior at UNL, writing his Honors Thesis about human trafficking and sexual exploitation in urban and rural Nebraska and Thailand.</p>
